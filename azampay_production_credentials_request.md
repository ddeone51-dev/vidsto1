Subject: Request for Production Credentials - Payment Integration

Dear AzamPay Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to request production credentials for the AzamPay payment gateway integration. We have successfully completed testing our payment integration using the sandbox environment and are now ready to move to production.

**Application Details:**
- Application Name: [Your App Name]
- Business/Company Name: [Your Company Name]
- Contact Person: [Your Name]
- Email: [Your Email]
- Phone: [Your Phone Number]
- Website/Application URL: [Your Website URL]

**Current Status:**
We have successfully integrated AzamPay payment gateway in our application using the sandbox credentials. Our integration includes:
- Mobile Money payments (M-Pesa, Tigo Pesa, Azam Pesa, Airtel Money, Halo Pesa)
- Bank checkout payments (CRDB, NMB)
- Payment callback/webhook handling
- Payment status verification

**What We Need:**
We would like to request the following production credentials:
1. Production Client ID
2. Production Client Secret
3. Production App Name
4. Production API endpoints (if different from sandbox)
5. Any additional configuration requirements for production

**Additional Information:**
- Our callback URL for production: [Your Production Callback URL]
- We have implemented proper error handling and logging
- We are ready to go live once we receive the production credentials

**Questions:**
1. Are there any additional steps or documentation required before we can receive production credentials?
2. Is there a specific approval process or requirements we need to meet?
3. What is the typical timeline for receiving production credentials?
4. Are there any differences in the API endpoints or request/response formats between sandbox and production?

We are committed to following all AzamPay guidelines and best practices for payment processing. We would appreciate your assistance in moving forward with the production integration.

Thank you for your time and support. Please let me know if you need any additional information from our side.
