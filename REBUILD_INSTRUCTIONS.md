# Rebuild Instructions

## ✅ Completed: server/app.js
I've successfully rebuilt `server/app.js` with ALL endpoints:
- ✅ Auth endpoints (register, login, /me)
- ✅ Payment endpoints (initiate, callback, status)
- ✅ Video library endpoints (save, get, delete)
- ✅ Plans endpoints
- ✅ Credits endpoint
- ✅ Featured videos endpoint
- ✅ All existing endpoints (story, scenes, narration, images, tts, video)

## 🔄 Next: web/src/App.tsx
Due to the file size (needs to be 1000+ lines), I'll create it with:
- Navigation system with pages (Home, Library, Featured Videos, Plans)
- All component imports
- Authentication state management
- Payment modal integration
- Video saving functionality
- Complete UI with navigation menu
